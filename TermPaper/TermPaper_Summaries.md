[1] Title: Extract, Transform, and Load Big Data with Apache Hadoop

Hadoop is a tool to extract the relevant data from a huge flow of data. Usually any data mining process include the ETL combination with the BI tool. Hadoop can be applied even for the relational databases like Oracle where we use Apache Sqoop tool. In this case we can consider Hadoop is acting as a reporting or a BI tool. But the question about the how much Hadoop is efficient than the traditional BI tool is still an unresolved question.  Hadoop is capable of extracting the data from the different file formats present in the distributed file systems and in this case Hadoop looks like a traditional ETL tool.

[2] Title: Hadoop in Data Warehousing 

The author here defines how hadoop is efficient in processing the unstructured data and used to process the media files. Importance of the Business Intelligence system is also defined and how Business Intelligence system is efficient to process the structured data. Author says Hadoop is a translator ETL system but was never been considered as a replacement of the ETL system. The importance of co-existence of Business Intelligence system and Hadoop is defined in this paper.

[3] Title: Map-Reduce-Merge: Simplified Relational Data Processing on Large Clusters 

The author here believes Map-Reduce is much efficient for the huge unrelated data using parallel processing concept. But Map-Reduce does not support the related heterogeneous dataset which basically uses joins for processing and getting the relevant data. A new merge phase is included in this process where all the database principles are been followed and this is known as Map-Reduce-Merge used to process the related datasets.

[4] Title: Parallel Data Processing with MapReduce: A Survey 

Map-Reduce is much appreciated for the data processing in parallel and the information about the parallel processing is not visible to the user for reducing the complexity. Pro and cons of how Map-reduce works with the RDBS operations is defined and finally it is been confirmed that Map-Reduce is unlikely to substitute RDBMS even for data warehousing.

[5] Title: An Overview of Data Warehousing and OLAP Technology

The complete architectural design of ETL and OLAP system is defined in this paper and tools used to process the data at every phase of the development is defined in this paper and a sample relational database design using star schema is provided and explained. A clear description of the metadata of the input data is been provided and details about the warehouse management is provided. This paper provides the complete n to n structure of the data warehousing.
