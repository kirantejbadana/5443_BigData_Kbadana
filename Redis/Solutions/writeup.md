1. I have used the set data strucure in redies which will store the key value pairs and the property of the list is it will store the unique values and scard function is to count the length of set which finally gives the unique count of the food items.

2. I have used the nested loop to extract the data from the nutrition information after getting this informaytion. This is a lJSON information and this is a decoded information to get the unique data values the data values are puhed into the set and get the count using scard which will return the the size of the set. This will return all the unique nutrition values present in the json.
